This project based on the LIBRA project(https://github.com/libra/libra.git).
The purpose is to build a light network infrastructure for the 
blockchain project. Specially for the  permissoned blockchain.
Someone may say the Libp2p project is good. But I think the libp2p is
perfect for the long lantency project. When you in a permissioned 
blockchain you should get the low lantency and high output.
Last year when the Libra project came out. At first it was a permissionless
public blockchain. But after 2020.05 it was redesigned to meet some 
regulations.
After all. This project just extract the network from libra to 
a general useage network lib. 

The general design is a swarm to manage serveral nodes.
